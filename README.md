Title: Code Snippet Manager

Description: This program is mainly developed for developers. They use multiple code snippets frequently and they have to write the same code manually or copy from other files of them or search web. In every of these ways, they are wasting their time. 
This program will help them to store their code snippets in their local storage and will provide them easy access to their frequently used code snippets which save their valuable time.

Features: 
As the options suggest,
1. You can copy code directly to your clipboard and paste where you want
2. You can print any specific code in the terminal
3. You can insert new code with title manually
4. You can insert new code directly from any file (the title will be the file name)
5. You can insert any existing code to any file
6. You can delete any code snippet
7. You can modify any code snippet
8. You can show the full list of saved code snippets

To compile and run, you have to go that folder where the main file 'csm.py' and other files are situated and run the statement in the terminal "python3 csm.py". That will be it.

Challenges: 

Future enhancements:
1. Add chatGPT to get access to code snippets that are not saved yet in the storage.
2. Add an online storage to increase the storage and get an option to access the saved code snippets from any other devices.
3. Add a search tool to search specific code snippets without knowing their ID (Best for large database).
4. Optional: an UI interface.
